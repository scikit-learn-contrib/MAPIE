# Notes:
# - Make sure to update the pypi and testpypi Trusted Publishers in the settings of your PyPI and TestPyPI accounts.
# - Configure GitHub Environments named `pypi` and `testpypi` in your repository settings.
# - For `pypi` the environment should require manual approval (recommended by PyPI Trusted Publishing).
# - After switching to Trusted Publishing you should remove any long-lived PYPI API token secrets from the repo and
#   revoke them on PyPI/TestPyPI as described in the PyPI guide.

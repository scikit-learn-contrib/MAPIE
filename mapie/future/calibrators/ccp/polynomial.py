class PolynomialCCP(CCPCalibrator):
    """
    Calibrator based on :class:`~mapie.future.calibrators.ccp.CCPCalibrator`,
    used in :class:`~mapie.future.split.SplitCPRegressor` or
    :class:`~mapie.future.split.SplitCPClassifier`
    to estimate the conformity scores.

    It corresponds to the adaptative conformal prediction method proposed by
    Gibbs et al. (2023) in "Conformal Prediction With Conditional Guarantees".

    The goal is to learn the quantile of the conformity scores distribution,
    to built the prediction interval, not with a constant ``q`` (as it is the
    case in the standard CP), but with a function ``q(X)`` which is adaptative
    as it depends on ``X``.

    This class builds a :class:`~mapie.future.calibrators.ccp.CCPCalibrator`
    object with polynomial features of ``X``, ``y_pred`` or ``z``.

    See the examples and the documentation to build a
    :class:`~mapie.future.calibrators.ccp.CCPCalibrator`
    adaptated to your dataset and constraints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    degree: Union[int, List[int]]
        If ``degree`` is an integer, it correspond to the degree of the
        polynomial features transformer. It will create the features
        ``1``, ``variable``, ``variable``**2, ..., ``variable``**``degree``.

        If ``degree`` is a list of integers, it will create the features
        ``variable``**d, for all integer d in ``degree``

        ``variable`` may be ``X``, ``y_pred`` or ``z``, depending on the
        ``variable`` argument value.

        If ``None``, it will default to ``degree=1``.

        .. note::
            if ``0`` is in the considered exponents (if ``degree`` is an
            integer, or if ``0 in degree`` if it is a list), it is not
            ``variable**0`` of shape ``(n_samples, n_in)`` which is added,
            but only one feature of ones, of shape ``(n_samples, 1)``.
            It is actually equivalent to ``bias=True``.

        By default ``None``.

    variable: Literal["X", "y_pred", "z"]
        String, used to choose which argument between ``X``, ``y_pred`` and
        ``z`` is used to build the polynomial features.

        By default ``"X"``

    bias: bool
        Add a column of ones to the features,
        (to make sure that the marginal coverage is guaranteed).
        If the ``CCPCalibrator`` object definition covers all the dataset
        (meaning, for all calibration and test samples, the resulting
        ``calibrator.predict(X, y_pred, z)`` is never all zeros),
        this column of ones is not necessary to obtain marginal coverage.
        In this case, you can set this argument to ``False``.

        If you are not sure, use ``bias=True`` to garantee the marginal
        coverage.

        By default ``False``.

    normalized: bool
        Whether or not to normalized the resulting
        ``calibrator.predict(X, y_pred, z)``. Normalization
        will result in a bounded interval prediction width, avoiding the width
        to explode to +inf or crash to zero. It is particularly intersting when
        you know that the conformity scores are bounded. It also prevent the
        interval to have a width of zero for out-of-distribution samples.
        On the opposite, it is not recommended if the conformity
        scores can vary a lot.

        By default ``False``

    init_value: Optional[ArrayLike]
        Optimization initialisation value.
        If ``None``, is sampled from a normal distribution.

        By default ``None``.

    reg_param: Optional[float]
        Float to monitor the ridge regularization
        strength. ``reg_param`` must be a non-negative
        float i.e. in ``[0, inf)``.

        .. warning::
            A too strong regularization may compromise the guaranteed
            marginal coverage. If ``calibrator.normalize=True``, it is usually
            recommanded to use ``reg_param < 1e-3``.

        If ``None``, no regularization is used.

        By default ``None``.

    Attributes
    ----------
    transform_attributes: Optional[List[str]]
        Name of attributes set during the ``fit`` method, and required to call
        ``transform``.

    fit_attributes: Optional[List[str]]
        Name of attributes set during the ``fit`` method, and required to call
        ``predict``.

    n_in: int
        Number of features of ``X``

    n_out: int
        Number of features of ``calibrator.transform(X, y_pred, z)``

    exponents: List[int]
        List of exponents of the built polynomial features

    beta_up_: Tuple[NDArray, bool]
        Calibration fitting results, used to build the upper bound of the
        prediction intervals.
        beta_up_[0]: Array of shape (calibrator.n_out, )
        beta_up_[1]: Whether the optimization process converged or not
                    (the coverage is not garantied if the optimization fail)

    beta_low_: Tuple[NDArray, bool]
        Same as beta_up, but for the lower bound

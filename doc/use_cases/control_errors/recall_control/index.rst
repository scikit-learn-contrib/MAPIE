Recall Control
==============

Recall control in machine learning risk management focuses on maximizing the detection of true positive cases, ensuring that as many relevant instances as possible are correctly identified. This is particularly critical in applications where missing positive cases (false negatives) can have significant consequences, such as in medical diagnostics, fraud detection, or safety-critical systems.

By adjusting decision thresholds, incorporating cost-sensitive learning, or employing recall-boosting techniques, practitioners can tailor models to prioritize recall while balancing other performance metrics like precision. Recall control ensures that machine learning systems are sensitive to domain-specific requirements where capturing all relevant cases is paramount.

This section provides an in-depth exploration of the methods and strategies to achieve effective recall control across various machine learning applications.

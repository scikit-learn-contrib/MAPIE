Precision Control
===================

Precision control in machine learning risk management is the practice of fine-tuning model predictions to balance accuracy and risk based on specific domain requirements. In contexts where errors carry varying levels of consequence (e.g., false positives in medical diagnoses or false negatives in fraud detection), precision control ensures that model outputs align with acceptable thresholds of risk.

By strategically adjusting decision boundaries, thresholds, or weighting factors, precision control allows practitioners to optimize for specific outcomes, such as minimizing the cost of errors, maximizing return on investment, or complying with safety standards.

This section explores the foundational principles, algorithms, and methodologies that enable precision control in risk-sensitive machine learning applications.

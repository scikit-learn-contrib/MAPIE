In addition to the methods implemented in MAPIE, we link to an external `repository <https://github.com/thibaultcordier/risk-control>`_ dedicated to risk control, developed by Thibault Cordier.
This package implements the Learn-Then-Test (LTT) method and applies it to both regression and classification tasks. It also supports multi-risk and multi-threshold settings, therefore offering a comprehensive and flexible framework for a wide range of risk control scenarios.

.. important:: Please note that this repository is independent from MAPIE and is not maintained by the MAPIE team.

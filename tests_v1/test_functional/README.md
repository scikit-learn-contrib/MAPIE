# Scope

Folder for testing the main functionalities of the API as seen from a user point-of-view.

# Philosophy

- New tests here should be added wisely.
- Group tests in a class if more than one test is needed for a given functionality.
- Be careful of test time. Testing varied scenarios is more important than trying to test all scenarios.
- Write black-box tests if possible (no mocks): don't test implementation details.

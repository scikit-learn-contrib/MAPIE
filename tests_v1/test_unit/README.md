# Scope

Folder for testing small functions ("unit" = function).

# Philosophy

- Group tests in a class if more than one test is needed for a given function.
- Focus on the function goal to define the test cases (the function name is a good hint).
- Prefer black-box tests (no mocks) if possible, to avoid testing implementation details.

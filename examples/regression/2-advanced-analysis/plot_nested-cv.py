==========================================================================================
Hyperparameters tuning with CrossConformalRegressor
==========================================================================================


This example compares non-nested and nested cross-validation strategies
when using
:class:`~mapie.regression.CrossConformalRegressor`.

In the regular sequential method, a cross-validation parameter search is performed
on the entire training set. The best model is then used in MAPIE to estimate
prediction intervals. However, as MAPIE computes residuals on
the validation dataset used during hyperparameter tuning, it can lead to
overfitting. This fools MAPIE into being slightly too optimistic with confidence
intervals.

To solve this problem, an alternative option is to perform a nested
cross-validation parameter search directly within the MAPIE estimator on each
*out-of-fold* dataset.
This ensures that residuals seen by MAPIE are never seen by the algorithm
beforehand. However, this method is much heavier computationally since
it results in ``N * P`` calculations, where *N* is the number of
*out-of-fold* models and *P* the number of parameter search cross-validations,
versus ``N + P`` for the non-nested approach.

Here, we compare the two strategies on a toy dataset.

The two approaches give slightly different predictions with the nested CV
approach estimating larger prediction interval in average.

For this example, the two approaches result in identical scores and identical
effective coverages.

In the general case, the recommended approach is to use nested
cross-validation, since it does not underestimate conformity scores and hence
prediction intervals. However, in this particular example, effective
coverages of both nested and non-nested methods are the same.

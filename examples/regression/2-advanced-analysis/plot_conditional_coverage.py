Estimating conditional coverage
===============================
This example uses :func:`~mapie.regression.MapieRegressor` with conformal
scores that returns adaptive intervals i.e.
(:class:`~mapie.conformity_scores.GammaConformityScore` and
:class:`~mapie.conformity_scores.ResidualNormalisedScore`) as well as
:func:`~mapie.regression.MapieQuantileRegressor`.
The conditional coverage is computed with the three
functions that allows to estimate the conditional coverage in regression
:func:`~mapie.metrics.regression_ssc`,
:func:`~mapie.metrics.regression_ssc_score` and :func:`~mapie.metrics.hsic`.

# We can see here that the global coverage is approximately the same for
# all methods. What we want to understand is : "Are these methods good
# adaptive conformal methods ?". For this we have the two metrics
# :func:`~mapie.metrics.regression_ssc_score` and :func:`~mapie.metrics.hsic`.
# - SSC (Size Stratified Coverage) is the maximum violation of the coverage :
#   the intervals are grouped by width and the coverage is computed for each
#   group. The lower coverage is the maximum coverage violation. An adaptive
#   method is one where this maximum violation is as close as possible to the
#   global coverage. If we interpret the result for the four methods here :
#   CV+ seems to be the better one.
# - And with the hsic correlation coefficient, we have the
#   same interpretation : :func:`~mapie.metrics.hsic` computes the correlation
#   between the coverage indicator and the interval size, a value of 0
#   translates an independence between the two.
#
# We would like to highlight here the misinterpretation that can be made
# with these metrics. In fact, here CV+ with the absolute residual score
# calculates constant intervals which, by definition, are not adaptive.
# Therefore, it is very important to check that the intervals widths are well
# spread before drawing conclusions (with a plot of the distribution of
# interval widths or a visualisation of the data for example).
#
# In this example, with the hsic correlation coefficient, none of the methods
# stand out from the others. However, the SSC score for the method using the
# gamma score is significantly worse than for CQR and ResidualNormalisedScore,
# even though their global coverage is similar. ResidualNormalisedScore and CQR
# are very close here, with ResidualNormalisedScore being slightly more
# conservative.

# With toy datasets like this, it is easy to compare visually the methods
# with a plot of the data and predictions.
# As mentionned above, a histogram of the ditribution of the interval widths is
# important to accompany the metrics. It is clear from this histogram
# that CV+ is not adaptive, the metrics presented here should not be used
# to evaluate its adaptivity. A wider spread of intervals indicates a more
# adaptive method.
# Finally, with the plot of coverage by bins of intervals grouped by widths
# (which is the output of :func:`~mapie.metrics.regression_ssc`), we want
# the bins to be as constant as possible around the global coverage (here 0.9).

# As the previous metrics show, gamma score does not perform well in terms of
# size stratified coverage. It either over-covers or under-covers too much.
# For ResidualNormalisedScore and CQR, while the first one has several bins
# with over-coverage, the second one has more under-coverage. These results
# are confirmed by the visualisation of the data: CQR is better when the data
# are more spread out, whereas ResidualNormalisedScore is better with small
# intervals.
